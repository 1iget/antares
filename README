ANTARES is an all-in-one buildsystem, aimed at baremetal targets
it is designed to be portable across a lot of MCU arches and 
adding another MCU is trivial. 
I utilizes Kconfig from linux kernel, and a set of homebrew
Makefiles, designed to easen the process. 
Currently somewhat supported architecture and targts are:
AVR ARM/STM32 MSP430 GBZ80
This stuff is still pre-alpha quality, so if things don't work for you out of the box - drop me a line.

Abstract.
---------
Traditional buildsystems (cmake, scons, autotools etc.) are very
painful to use when it comes to bare metal targets.
Proprietary crippled IDEs from vendors like IAR/CodeComposer, etc.
provide their own project management, but they are generally a pain 
to use, espesially if you are mostly used to VIM/emacs (like me).
You can, of course, hook iar c to Makefiles, but you'll still spend
more time figuring out how to do that, then writing the code. 
While the above IDEs make it simpler to create some 'write&forget'
projects fast, they suck when it comes to maintaining a lot of shared
code between projects.   
Things get even worse, when you face a problem, when your project has to support 2 different mcus with totally different 'conventional' IDEs/compilers. 
The best way to manage a very configurable project with a lot of 
library code is Kconfig as seen in linux kernel. Mostly because it
handles dependencies of parameters and you won't eventually have a 
huge mess in your config.h. 
And the config can be used in Makefiles as well. 
So, there we go. 

Yet another arduino?
--------------------
It is not arduino. It doesn't aim to provide any crippled IDE
for your projects. You are free to use whatever IDE/editor you
like. VIM/emacs users welcome. Eclipse? You're welcome. Kdevelop? Sure.  
It doesn't make you think that you are writing in any 'innovative' 
programming language, nor aims to provide an IDE. It's mostly just 
plain C. Antares just handles configuring your project, building and 
deploying. Consider it an overgrown Makefile.
Although antares comes with quite some library code, you are free
to NOT use any of it. The choice is yours to make.

So, in short antares is...
--------------------------
A set of Makefiles, scripts and a bunch of library code, that can be used 
(and reused) in your projects, bundled with kconfig. 

Supported architectures
------------------------
Currently a few architectures are supported: 
avr, msp430, arm(stm32), 8051, gbz80
Others are being added as the hardware comes along. 

Supported operating systems
---------------------------
Currently only Linux and FreeBSD have been tested. 
Mac should (theoretically) work - if you have a second to run a quick
test, please contact me and I will update this README. (Or fix a bug or two) 
Windows *might* work (cygwin), but it's currently NOT the platform antares is aimed to be used at.

Is antares buildsystem okay to compile in multiple threads?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Feel free to supply the -jXX flag to speed things up. It should work. If it doesn't - submit a bug report. 

Any documentation?
------------------
The documentation is maintained in 'thebuggenie wiki', avaliable in
English and Russian.  
Just navigate to antares.ncrmnt.org and press the 'DOCS' link. 

Opensource?
-----------

Hell, yes. Although the licence is GPLv2, some library code from third
parties may come with a different license. Figuring out the licensing stuff
is also WiP.
