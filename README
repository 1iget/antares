ANTARES is an all-in-one buildsystem, that is designed to
be portable across a lot of MCU arches. 
I utilises Kconfig from linux kernel, and a set of homebrew
Makfiles. 
Currently somewhat supported arches are:
AVR ARM/STM32 MSP430
This stuff is still pre-alpha quality, so if you want to
give it a try - better drop me a line. DRAGONS AHEAD.
