  A tiny debugging library for those running in environments where 
  enabling a sprintf() inplementation is not affordable. 
  printk() will send data, and format to the host, and the host 
  will printf the data. 
  
config LIB_DEBUG_FULL
bool "Full-blown debugging library"
help
  A printk() implementation. Strings optionally prefixed for 
  filtering on the host.
