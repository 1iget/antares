     A very basic implementation, with a static
     export table, no compiler magic, etc. 
     Designed to be suitable for very small systems,
     e.g. 8051 micros.

help
	A simple, quick and dirty serial transport
	with no checksumming. You should provide your
	own 'putchar' and call 'gotchar' whenever a
	character is received.

help
	If set to 'y' methods may be run in ISR
	context, if the underlying transport layer
	does the call to urpc_handle_incoming there.
	You can set that to 'n' and do the processing
	in the loop later.
