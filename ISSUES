This project is no way perfect, and there are quite a few BUGS, 
that still need to be adressed. 

* Buildsystem: The current set of Makefiles is way TOO hacky in 
  places and looks as if it was coded by "an undergrad on exess 
  coffeine" (c) Alan Cox. This should be dealt with. For now - 
  it works, so let it be. 

* Library code. We need MOAR library code. It should be opensource
  and PORTABLE (e.g. SDCC and GCC at the very least). Some arches, 
  like STM32 supply a whole set of library code, but that can be 
  only used only for that MCUs. Using it for anything else is 
  unethical at the very least, and breaks the license. (In case of 
  stellarisware).

* Testing framework. We need a set of tests for the library code, 
  that can be used to test for regressions. 

* CLANG support. People are hypnotised by this word. We should try 
  it sometime.
