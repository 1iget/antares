  help
    Basically, this places an endless loop in main()
    suggesting, that you do all the stuff in ISR's
  
  config TASK_SIMPLE
  bool "Simple single-threaded application"
  help
    This is a simplest application method ever. 
    Looks quite arduino-like. You have your init
    function, and an optional loop(). 
  

  config TASK_VUSB
  bool "VUSB-based loop"
  depends on ARCH_AVR
  help
   This turns on VUSB stack for your device
   In this model your code can be placed 
   between usb_poll() in main loop. 

  config TASK_ANTARES
  bool "Antares Real-Time Kernel"
  help
    Multiple init/loop tasks
    Module load/unload on-the-run
    Like linux for the 8bits
